# Platformers

Following Kennedy's lead I have found all games at https://www.classicdosgames.com/genre/platform.html

## Vinyl Goddess From Mars

When moving quickly coming to a stop takes a brief slide, but very little. When moving slower direction can be changed instantly. Jump is non-variable and over twice as high as the player sprite. Holding jump will make you jump instantly when meeting the ground, but there is no double jump. You can cling onto vines and crawl up them, so the level has many locations where you need to do this to move forward, however you cannot shoot at enemies when climbing so there are locations where you must quickly dismount the vine to defeat them. Camera follows player, but up arrow key pans camera up to see more. There is a bridge that bends slightly under the players feet, which I thought was a nice little touch. 

## Zool

Can cling to walls but not climb them, but you can jump off them and turn mid-air to catch higher and climb them this way. You can stomp on enemies to destroy them. Movement is very responsive with a little bit of momentum and fast stopping. Jump is so high that the camera loses sight of the ground. There are plenty of locations where you must do the one-wall jump to move forward, and a lot of enemies to crush. This game feels a little better than Vinyl but it also makes me nauseous to play with the camera. It seems to thrive on not knowing whats ahead, which is fascilitated by the tight camera, so it feels more like a game of memorization of the levels than skill based. 

## Pharaoh's Tomb

Movement is instant but slow, there is no acceleration or slide. The jump is not variable. You have only one life and you cannot crush your enemies. Okay so you actually have more than one life, you just get shoved to the beginning of the level when you die. So its more accurate to say you have no health. There are moving platforms and coins you can collect, as well as other ... artifacts?
