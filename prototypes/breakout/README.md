# Breakout Reflection
## Breakout-1
/t The goal of breakout version 1 was to create something that resembled the game of breakout in basic function. These goals included a ball that bounces, bricks that break, and a paddle that moves. While these are very low standards, they are the foundations upon which everything else is built. 

/t In the making of this version I reaquainted myself with the basics of unity. I learned how to destroy gameobjects, lock movement onto certain axes, and create gameobjects at runtime with an array. More broadly I learned the true scope of even a "simple" game like breakout and how many variables there are that one can tune to totally change the way the game plays. Variables include: brick size and spacing, ball speed, paddle size and speed, ball bounce angle, width of playing field, and many more. 

/t From my playtesters I learned mostly about a lot of small issues. The way the paddle movement felt and the speed of the ball, for example. Mostly though the changes I would make for version 2 were from my own observations.
